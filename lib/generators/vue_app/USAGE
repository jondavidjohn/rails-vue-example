Description:
    This generator creates the structure you need to create a new Vue app.

    Once generated, you can then render the app in any slim template with

      = vue_app :new_app

Example:
    rails generate vue_app new-app

    This will create:
        app/javascript/packs/new-app.js # The entry point for your app
        app/javascript/apps/new-app/index.vue # The primary index of your app
        tests/javascript/apps/new-app/index.test.js # The associated spec file for your app
